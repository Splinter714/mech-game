// polygon fading to fully transparent exactly at the true hex boundary, combined with
// Phaser's `roundPixels` (forced on by `pixelArt: true`, main.js) snapping each tile's
// on-screen position independently every frame as the camera scrolls. The fix is bleeding
// each tile's outer polygon `HEX_BLEED` px past the true radius so its opaque interior
// already covers the boundary — these are pure-geometry checks that the bleed actually
// creates overlap (not just a bigger number) and that the texture canvas still comfortably
// contains the bled shape.
