// Timed combat powerups (#60). Killing an enemy (later: facilities / world resources) can
// drop a world-space collectible that grants a TEMPORARY combat buff. This file is the pure,
// data-driven core: the powerup table (types + durations/magnitudes/weights, all tunable in
// one place), the weighted pick, the buff-overlay math (how N simultaneously-active buffs
// combine into the multipliers/flags the arena reads), and the proportional armor-repair calc.
// No Phaser — the arena mixin (scenes/arena/powerups.js) owns the collectible sprites,
// collision, and countdown; this file is fully unit-tested (powerups.test.js).
//
// Design rules baked in here:
//  - Buffs are an OVERLAY on top of the live Mech, never a mutation of the model, so they
//    expire cleanly. `buffModifiers(active)` collapses the set of active types into a plain
//    object the firing/movement code multiplies against.
//  - Stacking is ONE-PER-TYPE: several different types can be active at once (each with its
//    own countdown); picking up a duplicate of an active type just refreshes that type's time.
//  - Armor Patch is INSTANT (no timer) — it applies its repair on pickup and never enters the
//    active set.
//  - Shield (#246, reworked from #187) is a THIRD kind, alongside timed buffs and instants: it
//    acts on the mech's own NATIVE shield layer (Mech.shield / HpBody.shield — data/shield.js),
//    which is now a real trait every body can be configured with (chassis baseline for the
//    player, per-kind data for enemies — see enemyKinds.js), not a powerup-only pool. Picking
//    this up does BOTH things at once: instantly fills the shield to 100%, AND multiplies its
//    max capacity + regen rate by `boostMult` for `duration` seconds (Mech.boostShield). It
//    never enters `active`/`buffModifiers` — the arena mixin just calls `mech.boostShield`
//    directly (scenes/arena/powerups.js `_activatePowerup`).

// #106: the drop-chance bounds are derived from the LIVE enemy roster (see `dropBounds` below).
// #301: that derivation now lives in data/rosterBounds.js, shared with the death-explosion tiers.

  //    instead of 7, a Repeater runs 4 tracer lanes instead of 2, a Streak Pod unloads 12
  //    missiles instead of 6, a Plasma Lance puts out 2 bolt streams instead of 1. Visually the
  //    loudest of the six, which is the point — it should read instantly without a HUD glance.
  //    Ammo is spent once per trigger pull (not per emitted shot), so this is straight bonus
  //    output for its duration; 10s / weight 1 keeps it in line with the other timed buffs.

// ── Drop tuning (#90 → #106) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A kill's powerup odds SCALE with how tough the thing you killed was. Two knobs decide the
// shape: the roster-derived floor/ceiling (which kill counts as "trivial" and which as "the
// hardest thing in the game") and the curve exponent between them.
//
// TOUGHNESS, not `maxHp` (#106). The difficulty signal is `body.toughness` — structure + armor
// + shield — exposed identically by `Mech` and the non-mech `HpBody`, so there's still no
// per-kind branching at the call site (combat.js `_damageEnemyAt`). This replaced `.maxHp`,
// which meant different things per body type: Mech summed armor+structure while HpBody
// returned only its hp pool, so vehicles' armor/shields were invisible to the curve (a tank
// rated 160 instead of its real 200; the gunship's 30-point shield and the Broodwalker's
// 60 armor + 50 shield counted for nothing) — vehicles were systematically under-rated.
//
// DERIVED BOUNDS (#106). `DROP_HP_FLOOR`/`DROP_HP_CEIL` used to be hand-set constants (14 and
// 400) and drifted out of sync with the roster every single time enemy stats moved — #128
// forced a manual re-solve of the exponent, and infantry (toughness 6) shipped without the
// floor ever being lowered to match. They're now COMPUTED from the live roster: the min and
// max toughness across every mech enemy (data/enemies.js) and every vehicle kind
// (data/enemyKinds.js). Retuning enemy health, or adding/removing a unit, needs NO edit here —
// the endpoints move on their own. Today that derives to floor 6 (infantry) and ceiling 430
// (the artillery mech on the heavy chassis).
//
// CURVE (#106): CONVEX, exponent 1.5. The previous 0.7 exponent was CONCAVE — it bowed the
// middle of the curve UP, roughly +10 percentage points across the mid-range versus a straight
// line, which is exactly the "weak/easy enemies pay out way too often" complaint this issue
// opened with. 1.5 bows the middle DOWN instead: trivial kills stay near the floor much longer
// and the payout only really climbs once you're fighting things that fight back. Both endpoints
// are unaffected by the exponent (0**k = 0, 1**k = 1), so the floor is still MIN_DROP_CHANCE
// and the toughest kill in the game is still MAX_DROP_CHANCE.
//
// Resulting curve across today's roster (toughness → chance):
//   infantry 6 → 5%      drone 14 → 5%       turret 90 → 13%    helicopter 100 → 14%
//   light mech 184 → 29% tank 200 → 33%      medium mech 290 → 54%
//   quadruped 370 → 77%  heavy mech 430 → 95%
// These numbers are DERIVED, not hand-solved — they're what the formula produces for the
// current roster, and they'll shift on their own when the roster does.
//
// CRUSH KILLS (#106) bypass the curve entirely — see CRUSH_KILL_DROP_CHANCE below.
//
// Historical note: #90 replaced a flat `DROP_CHANCE` roll (a drone and a heavy mech had
// identical odds) with this toughness-scaled curve. #128's chassis change forced a manual
// re-solve of the exponent, and #106's review found the hand-set bounds had drifted again —
// which is why the bounds are derived from the roster now instead of typed in.

// #106: a CRUSH/stomp kill (driving over a tank or a trooper — world.js `_crushGroundEnemyAt`,

// deliberately tiny chance. Jackson: "what feels odd about tanks is they are stompable, which
// works immediately regardless of their relatively higher HP. maybe we should set extremely low
// drop rates for any stomp kills, regardless of the enemy." A stomp costs the player nothing —
