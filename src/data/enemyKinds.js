// Non-mech enemy KINDS — data, not code (mirrors ENEMIES / WEAPONS / CHASSIS). Each entry
// fully describes a non-mech unit: its health, its damageable part layout (design coords, so
// procedural art + the arena's nearest-part hit-mapping line up), the weapon it fires (a real
// id from data/weapons.js, so no weapon-id literal ever leaks into scenes/arena/*), how fast
// and how it moves, whether it flies (ignores ground cover), and which registered ART builder
// and AI BEHAVIOR it uses. **Add a non-mech enemy = one entry here** — the arena builds it from
// this the same way it builds a Mech from ENEMIES.
//
// The `kind: 'mech'` default is implicit (absent from this table): an enemy with no `kind`
// stays a Mech and every existing enemy behaves UNCHANGED. Only the four entries below opt into
// the HpBody + per-kind art/behavior path.
//
// Fields:
//   name       display name (floats on spawn / used by feedback text).
//   hp         single-pool hit points (HpBody).
//   parts      { locId: {x,y,w,h} } damageable layout in mech-local design coords (−y forward).
//   muzzlePart which entry in `parts` a shot actually spawns from (#109) — the gun/barrel/nose,
//              not the unit's centre. Falls back to the first `parts` entry if omitted.
//   weaponId   which WEAPONS entry this unit fires (its delivery drives the projectile).
//   weapons    #305: the MULTI-WEAPON form. A kind that needs more than one gun declares a map
//              of SLOTS instead of the single top-level weaponId — `weapons: { nose: {...},
//              flank: {...} }` — where each slot carries its OWN weaponId, weaponOverride,
//              fireRange and burstShots/burstRestMs (every field below that describes a gun is
//              per-slot in this form). `defaultWeaponSlot` names the one a caller gets when it
//              doesn't ask. Slot keys are MOUNT/ROLE names, never weapon names, so weapon ids
//              still never leak out of this file. A kind with no `weapons` map is normalised
//              into one synthesised slot from its top-level fields, so every single-weapon kind
//              is unchanged. See data/kindWeapons.js for the seam and the helicopter below for
//              the live example (its live slot is chosen by FACING — data/gunshipCycle.js).
//   weaponOverride  #243: optional PARTIAL override merged onto the base weapon for THIS kind
//              only (resolveWeapon, data/weapons.js): top-level fields shallow-merge, the nested
//              `delivery` object also shallow-merges, and the base WEAPONS entry is never
//              mutated — so a kind can mount "the Repeater, but single-lane" as a one-line
//              delta instead of forking a whole near-duplicate weapon entry. See helicopter
//              below for the live example. Per the #243 playtest follow-up, overrides tune
//              cadence/stream/burst shape ONLY — never `damage`; enemy per-round damage always
//              matches the player's version of the weapon. (#244 carve-out: the turret's
//              override DOES set damage — it isn't an enemy-side retune of a shared weapon
//              but the old dedicated siegeShell entry, a distinct weapon with its own damage
//              identity, consolidated byte-identical into a napalm override. See the turret
//              entry + the enemyKinds.test.js damage-rule test.)
//              CADENCE lives here too (#243, superseding #241's transitional `fireEveryMs`
//              field entirely — it no longer exists): a vehicle's cooldown is ALWAYS
//              `_fireInterval` on the RESOLVED weapon (the same resolution the player/
//              mech-enemy path uses), so a kind that wants a slower/faster cadence tunes it
//              in the weapon's OWN terms — `weaponOverride: { cycleTime: 260 }` for a
//              single-shot weapon (drone/tank below), or
//              `weaponOverride: { delivery: { fireRate: 10/7 } }` for a stream weapon
//              (infantry below). One cadence concept, no parallel per-kind timer vocabulary.
//   fireRange  px at which it opens fire (falls back to the weapon's own max).
//   burstShots / burstRestMs  #243 trigger discipline (both optional): fire `burstShots` shots
//              at the normal cadence, then rest `burstRestMs` before the next burst can start
//              (the rest replaces the per-shot cooldown on the burst's last shot — see
//              `_fireVehicleWeapon`). Orthogonal to the weapon-derived cadence above, which
//              spaces the shots WITHIN a burst; deliberately KIND-level fields (not weapon
//              stats) because trigger discipline is how the unit squeezes the trigger, not
//              what the weapon is. Both absent ⇒ continuous fire, byte-identical to before;
//              the drone and helicopter opt in today. `burstRestMs` defaults to 1000 if only
//              `burstShots` is set.
//   flying     true ⇒ ignores walls/forest/water (flies over) AND draws a drop shadow (elevated).

//              tier, queried via shared.js's `unitSize`/`isSmallUnit` rather than read directly
//              off this table — that's the one canonical query point both the crush-eligibility
//              check (world.js `_crushTargetAt`) and the hex-vocabulary cover/LOS work go
//              through. 'small': tank, infantry (the two kinds already crushable on contact,
//              pre-#269 gated by the now-superseded CRUSHABLE_BEHAVIORS Set). 'large': turret,
//              drone, helicopter. A mech enemy (data/enemies.js) has no entry in this
//              table at all and is always 'large' — `unitSize` special-cases that.
//   scale      on-screen sprite size as a MULTIPLE of the arena mech scale (data-driven per #75;

//              down from 1.15 — it now spawns in tight clusters, see TURRET_CLUSTER_SIZE, so a
//              nest of tiny sentries reads right instead of one big one), tank 0.4 (down from
//              0.48 per the #269 dock-composition follow-up — 2-3 tanks now dock-cluster on one
//              hex), drone 0.52 (down from 0.62 per #91 — "drones slightly smaller again"),
//              helicopter 0.6 (down from 0.75 per the same #269 follow-up — a paired 2-heli

  //    emplacement — it lobs an arcing artillery shell (napalm + the weaponOverride below, #244;
  //    formerly the dedicated siegeShell entry) that never needs line-of-sight (arcing rounds
  //    skip wall collision entirely, see scenes/arena/projectiles.js) at a fireRange far beyond

  //    can't just hide from it either; you have to hunt it down or leave its enormous range.
  //    Per-shot damage/cadence are tuned down from the old autocannon numbers (see the

  //    reads as more/smaller sentries) with guaranteed uptime (no LOS to break) — several of the
  //    old autocannon's 16-dmg/1.1s cadence firing constantly and unavoidably would be brutal;
  //    the shell's 10 dmg (with range falloff further softening it near max range) on a slower
  //    2.6s cadence keeps a nest a real but survivable threat to actively deal with rather than an
  //    instant unavoidable shred. #145-followup: went from 3→4 turrets without raising per-shot
  //    damage/cadence, so a nest's total DPS rises ~33% — worth another playtest pass to confirm
  //    a 4-turret nest doesn't tip into "unavoidable shred" territory; if it does, softening the

  // 1b) WALL TURRET (#310) — the rail-lance gun mounted on a base wall's parapet.
  //
  // A DISTINCT KIND, not the `turret` above with a weaponOverride. Three reasons, in order of
  // weight:
  //   1. `weaponOverride` is a per-KIND field, not per-spawn. There is no mechanism by which two
  //      spawns of one kind mount different weapons, so "the turret kind with railLance instead of
  //      napalm" is not expressible as an override at all — it would require a forked kind
  //      regardless. The #243 mechanism is for tuning ONE weapon per owner, which is exactly what
  //      the `weaponOverride` below does do (rail lance, but a fortification's version of it).
  //   2. Almost nothing else would survive the override anyway. The sentry's identity is its
  //      napalm artillery: fireRange 2400, an arcing no-LOS lob, a 2.6s bombardment cadence. A
  //      parapet gun is a direct-fire hitscan sniper with an ordinary engagement envelope. The
  //      shared part is the HP pool and the "rooted, no locomotion" chassis — the smaller half.
  //   3. They must read as different objects. The player has to learn "sentry nest = incoming
  //      lobs you can hide from, wall gun = a lance down your throat if you're in its lane" and
  //      that lesson is impossible if they share a silhouette and a name.
  // Stats are deliberately IDENTICAL to the sentry's (#299's owner-set 35 structure + 15 armor) —
  // this is a different weapon on the same emplacement chassis, and the owner set that table.

    // (#243 resolveWeapon: top-level merged, `delivery` merged field-by-field, `range` replaced
    // WHOLESALE so it is restated complete) is the FORTIFICATION's version of that gun:
    //
    //   - NO damage override. The gun hits for the rail lance's own full 52.8, exactly as the
    //     player's does. This is the #243 playtest rule ("enemy rounds always match the player's
    //     weapon") and it is deliberately NOT bent here: the one standing exception is the
    //     sentry's shell, and that is excused only because it is a distinct consolidated weapon
    //     with its own damage identity (#244), not an enemy-side retune of a gun the player also
    //     mounts — which is precisely what softening the lance would be. It also turns out to be
    //     the right call on the merits: a half-weight lance would undercut the whole brief. The
    //     owner picked this weapon because "it telegraphs, it hits hard"; a 52.8 hit is ~9% of the
    //     player's health in one crack, which is the "hits hard" doing its job.
    //   - cycleTime 5200 vs the player's 2200. THE balance lever, and the one the #243 rule leaves
    //     open — difficulty here is carried by cadence and gun count, never by per-round damage.
    //     Better than 2.4x slower: the whole brief is that it telegraphs, so a long silent charge
    //     and then one heavy lance is the shape. A fast rail lance is just a laser, which is the
    //     exact thing the owner chose railLance OVER. At 5.2s a player can watch a gun wind up,
    //     break its lane, and have it miss — the gauntlet is readable and beatable rather than a
    //     raw DPS check. Per gun that is ~10 dps; with only two or three able to bear at once (every
    //     span of the ring except its own still blocks a gun — see TURRET_MOUNT_OFFSET_PX) a ring
    //     brings ~20-30 dps against
    //     a 600-toughness mech, i.e. a real cost to a slow approach and survivable to a brisk one.
    //   - range opt 520 / max 900, LONGER than the player's 400/640. A fixed emplacement on a
    //     parapet with a prepared field of fire should out-range a walking mech; it is what
    //     makes the guns matter during the APPROACH (the point of the issue) rather than only once
    //     the player is already at the wall. Still far short of the sentry's 2400 artillery

// load the #71/#76 performance fixes (per-enemy view/texture teardown, throttled impact FX) were
// built to hold up under; profiled at 18 concurrent drones (see #89 report) with headroom to
// spare, so this is picked as a strong "way more" without measurably hurting frame rate.

// small and sensible so it reads as an emplacement, not a wall of guns. #145-followup (playtest
// 2026-07-12: "could we try 2 or 4 at a time instead of 3?" — owner left the pick open): bumped
// 3 → 4, paired with a further scale shrink on the `turret` kind above, so the nest reads as
// "more, smaller" sentries rather than fewer, bigger ones. Easy to retune — just change this
// constant (see the turretClusterHexes/_spawnTurretCluster call sites, which are fully

// landing on this number — dial back if a future profile run shows it doesn't hold ~60fps.
